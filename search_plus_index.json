Viewing Docs Locally To preview the fully formatted docs as they will appear online, follow these steps: # Setup npm install npm run book:install # Rebuild HTML content (takes 3-5 minutes) npm run book:build # View HTML from a local webserver (using a file:// URL won't work) cd _book python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 # ...then open http://localhost:8000 Testing this way is important since formatting that looks fine in your Markdown viewer of choice may be interpreted differently by Gitbook's HTML generator.
