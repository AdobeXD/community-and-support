The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project. Code Of Conduct This project adheres to the Adobe code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com. Have A Question? Start by filing an issue. The existing committers on this project work to reach consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads (when appropriate). Please note the following: Pull Requests to the plugin-docs repository will be rejected; please file an issue for incorrect documentation instead. This is because we need to ensure that the issue is corrected in the internal source code. Pull Requests to the plugin-samples repository and other repositories in the AdobeXD organization are welcome. Please file an issue first so that your contribution can be discussed. Contributor License Agreement All third-party contributions to this project and associated repositories must be accompanied by a signed contributor license agreement. This gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Sign our CLA. You only need to submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go! Security Issues Security issues shouldn't be reported on this issue tracker. Instead, file an issue to our security experts. Viewing Docs Locally To preview the fully formatted docs as they will appear online, follow these steps: # Setup npm install npm run book:install # Rebuild HTML content (takes 3-5 minutes) npm run book:build # View HTML from a local webserver (using a file:// URL won't work) cd _book python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 # ...then open http://localhost:8000 Testing this way is important since formatting that looks fine in your Markdown viewer of choice may be interpreted differently by Gitbook's HTML generator.
